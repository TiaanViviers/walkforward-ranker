# Example Configuration
# This file contains dummy feature names for demonstration purposes.
# Copy this to production_config.yaml and replace with your actual feature names.

#   data/replay_window/{asset}_replay_window.parquet - 75% for walk-forward training
#   data/holdout/{asset}_holdout.parquet            - 15% for final testing
